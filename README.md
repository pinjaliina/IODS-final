# IODS-final
This repository fulfills the requirements of the Final assignment of the UH course “Introduction to Open Data Science”.

In this work, I’ve investigated how well it is possible to explain the regional differences in the share of the population with at least secondary education using other socioeconomic factors. The research area was the City of Helsinki and the data had been collected by the city; the year of the data was 2015. I performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data to reduce its dimensionality, and based on manual investigation of the data and the results of the PCA created a Linear Model (LM) that aims to explain the secondary or higher education ratio.

The results show quite clearly and rather surprisingly that the factor most clearly explaining the secondary education ratio is the rate of support for the Finns party in the national elections, even though unemployment rate, dependency on income support and population density also play a part; the Finns party support rate alone explains over 80% of the regional variability of the secondary or higher education rate.
